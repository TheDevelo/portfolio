## Counter-Strike Surf Levels
# [surf_polytron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwbm5nW4f0U)
As a part of the [KSF Winter 2021 Mapping Contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLc7ZYVy6ro), I designed and created the level **surf_polytron**.
**surf_polytron** was inspired by and created as an homage to the game _Fez_.
The level is a tough challenge, rated tier 5 out of 8.
[A video of professional Counter-Strike player **f0rest** playing the map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPExhv7G2lY) went decently viral.
