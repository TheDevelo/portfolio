Hi, I'm Robert Fuchs. I am currently in the Masters of Computer Science program at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated in 2023 from Washington University in St. Louis with a BS in Computer Science and a second major in Mathematics. I am interested in a career in Computer Graphics.

In my spare time, I like to develop video games. I have released multiple levels for Counter Strike's custom surf game mode, with [one of them getting 150K views on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPExhv7G2lY).
Here are links to all of my surf levels:
