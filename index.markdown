Hi, I'm Robert Fuchs.
I'm currently a student in the Masters of Computer Science program at Carnegie Mellon University.
I graduated in 2023 from Washington University in St. Louis with a BS in Computer Science and a second major in Mathematics.

I'm pursuing a career in computer graphics.
Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/) in the [Geometry Collective](https://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/) at CMU.
Feel free to check out my work in graphics [here](/graphics.html).

In my spare time, I like to develop video games. Most notably, I have released multiple levels for Counter-Strike's custom surf game mode, with some of my work attaining [viral success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPExhv7G2lY).
My publicly available levels can be found [here](/level_design.html).
