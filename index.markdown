# surf_polytron
As a part of the [KSF Winter 2021 Mapping Contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLc7ZYVy6ro) for Counter Strike, I designed and created the level **surf_polytron**. Inspired by the game _Fez_, **surf_polytron** has you traverse through many varying environments.

# Painters for Hire
Painters for Hire is an web-based multiplayer drawing and party game designed for 3 to 10 players. In a round of Painters for Hire, one players is assigned as judge. The judge submits a text prompt, which the other players must then draw in a short timeframe. After all players submit their drawings or time expires, the judge then ranks their 3 favorite drawings, who then gain points. The judge then cycles to another player, and another round is played. After a set amount of rounds, the player with the most points is determined winner.

Painters for Hire is written in the Godot game engine, with all client code written in GDScript. Additionally, the game server that connects clients together is written in Rust. Painters for Hire utilizes the WebRTC protocol to create a seamless Peer-to-Peer connection between players, allowing the server to be as minimal as possible.
