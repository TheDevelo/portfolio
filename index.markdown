Hi, I'm Robert Fuchs. I'm a current MSCS student at Carnegie Mellon University. I previously graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a BS in Computer Science and a second major in Mathematics. My current interests are in Computer Graphics.

In my spare time, I like to do video game development. I have notably released multiple levels for Counter Strike's custom surf game mode, with [one of them getting 150k views on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPExhv7G2lY).
Here is a list of all of my surf levels:
- [surf_polytron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwbm5nW4f0U)
